  "The suite under ClojureScript.

  This library is compiled into `kotobase-protocols-worker`, which serves
  s3 / atproto / pinning / sparql / gremlin / graphql on kotobase.net, so
  ClojureScript is where its code executes. The repo's own cljs path was
  `shadow-cljs compile test` -- a JVM build, which the murakumo fleet cannot
  run as an `:nbb-test` gate, so in practice only the JVM half was checked.

  Measured 2026-08-17, that mattered in both directions at once:

    - `multiformats.core/varint` built its ClojureScript branch on
      `unsigned-bit-shift-right`, which is int32 there, so 2^32 encoded to
      [128 0] -- a well-formed varint that decodes to zero -- while the JVM
      emitted the correct five octets. Nothing errored.
    - `multiaddr/read-varint` let its multiplier reach 128^9 = 2^63, so ten
      0x80 octets from a peer threw `ArithmeticException: long overflow` on
      the JVM, where the library's own \"varint too long\" guard never ran,
      while ClojureScript reported the intended refusal.

  One defect per host. A gate on either runtime alone sees exactly half.
